<b>What is MIDIBank?</b>

MIDIBank is a music collaboration site. It centers around sharing a MIDI file template and challenging others to build a song around it.

<b>Why MIDI?</b>

MIDI is usually considered an audio format. That's actually not true at all. The truth is, MIDI is just data. The file format is a storage container that stores notes, tempo, instrument type, track, etc. When imported into your favorite DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) it produces a template of the stored song. You can then change the instruments and build upon the song.

<b>How does the site work?<b>
  
You sign in and become a member. Then you can upload a MIDI to the collection or look at the currently uploaded MIDIs for inspiration. All MIDIs on the site are publically available to share. Once you choose a MIDI, you can download it and dop it into your DAW of choice.

Once you create a song from the template, return here to upload your mp3 under the respective MIDI's details page. There it can be played and voted on.

<b>Do I win anything?</b>

Absolutely not! So have fun!
